My blog has been located at 
[RyanData.wordpress.com](https://ryandata.wordpress.com) for many years.  

In the future, I will start posting about some of more personal thoughts about data and statistics directly on this site, but [RyanData.wordpress.com](https://ryandata.wordpress.com) will continue to be the place for Rutgers-related announcements of workshops and data developments.
