**Curriculum Vitae**

CV in [html](https://ryanwomack.com/rwomackcv.html) or

**Librarianship**

Since 2013, I serve as **Data Librarian** for the New Brunswick
Libraries, part of [Rutgers University
Libraries](https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/). Prior to this, I was
*Data and Economics Librarian*, and prior to that, *Business and Economics
Librarian*. Since 1999, I have been a member of the library faculty of
[Rutgers University-New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/). I
was granted tenure and promoted to the rank of Librarian II in 2005. In
2019, I was promoted to the rank of **Librarian I** (equivalent to Full
Professor). I hold an M.A. in Economics from the University of
Pennsylvania, an M.S. in Library Science from the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill, and an M.S. in Statistics and Biostatistics from
Rutgers University-New Brunswick.

As Data Librarian for Rutgers-New Brunswick, I am responsible for [Data Services](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/data),
including outreach and training for data, assisting students and faculty, acquisition of data sources, development of research guides, and
providing support for quantitative research across a range of
disciplines. I led the development of the [Graduate Specialist Program](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist), hiring Rutgers-NB graduate students to teach [workshops](https://libcal.rutgers.edu/nblworkshops) and provide consultations in advanced research methods, including Python, R, and other [data science](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/datascience) topics. I am serving from 2022 to 2025 as the *Head of the New Brunswick Libraries Research Services Unit*. I am particularly interested in developing and supporting data literacy and statistical literacy.

I am the subject specialist for and liaison to the [Department of
Economics](https://economics.rutgers.edu/), and the [Department of
Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics](https://dafre.rutgers.edu/).
I manage the Libraries' collections, give instructional sessions, and
help researchers and students locate information in these disciplines. I am also the New Brunswick Libraries Point of Contact for Government Documents and Statistical Data Services.

Some occasional thoughts about data and other things are at my [blog here](https://ryanwomack.com/blog). I also maintain the Libraries research guide for
[Data](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/data) and for [Economics](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/economics).

A current focus for me is the development of useful guides to data and statistical resources related to Mongolia and the countries of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan).
The [Central Asia and Mongolia Gender Data Portal (CAMGDP)](https://camgdp.org) exemplifies this.
