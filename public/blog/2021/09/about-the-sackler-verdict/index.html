<p class="timestamp">September 4, 2021</p>
<p>I am still torn up by the Sackler verdict, which absolves the Sackler family of guilt for deceptively promoting addictive and ultimately deadly drugs in order to boost their all-American profits.  The result was over 500,000 all-American corpses due to overdose, and the judicial system&rsquo;s recent verdict has only awarded approximately enough money to cover the funeral expenses of these corpses.  The Sacklers get to pay these expenses over a decade while keeping their fortunes intact and being shielded from further prosecution.</p>
<p>This is justice in America, no different than it ever was.</p>
<p>What can I do about it?  I suppose try to stay away from rich people, if they are empowered to kill me with impunity, or immunity under the law.  That is fortunately easy for me to do.</p>
<p>Also, I vow to never enter another art gallery named after the Sackler family, such as those at the Smithsonian or the Met.  I do not want the world of art to merely represent a temple to corruption, for the worship of the wealthy, and a place to purchase indulgences for murderous activities.  I would like to hope that there is a little bit of social benefit for art beyond that. But as long as the leading cultural institutions of the United States name their galleries after mass murderers, I am not sure that my nostalgic beliefs are justified.  Is art just killing once removed?  I want to do my part to reverse this trend.</p>
