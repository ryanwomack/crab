<p><strong>Curriculum Vitae</strong></p>
<p>CV in <a href="https://ryanwomack.com/rwomackcv.html">html</a> or
<a href="https://ryanwomack.com/rwomackcv.pdf">pdf</a> format.</p>
<p><strong>Librarianship</strong></p>
<p>Since 2013, I serve as <strong>Data Librarian</strong> for the New Brunswick
Libraries, part of <a href="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University
Libraries</a>. Prior to this, I was
<em>Data and Economics Librarian</em>, and prior to that, <em>Business and Economics
Librarian</em>. Since 1999, I have been a member of the library faculty of
<a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University-New Brunswick</a>. I
was granted tenure and promoted to the rank of Librarian II in 2005. In
2019, I was promoted to the rank of <strong>Librarian I</strong> (equivalent to Full
Professor). I hold an M.A. in Economics from the University of
Pennsylvania, an M.S. in Library Science from the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill, and an M.S. in Statistics and Biostatistics from
Rutgers University-New Brunswick.</p>
<p>As Data Librarian for Rutgers-New Brunswick, I am responsible for <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/data">Data Services</a>,
including outreach and training for data, assisting students and faculty, acquisition of data sources, development of research guides, and
providing support for quantitative research across a range of
disciplines. I led the development of the <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist">Graduate Specialist Program</a>, hiring Rutgers-NB graduate students to teach <a href="https://libcal.rutgers.edu/nblworkshops">workshops</a> and provide consultations in advanced research methods, including Python, R, and other <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/datascience">data science</a> topics. I am serving from 2022 to 2025 as the <em>Head of the New Brunswick Libraries Research Services Unit</em>. I am particularly interested in developing and supporting data literacy and statistical literacy.</p>
<p>I am the subject specialist for and liaison to the <a href="https://economics.rutgers.edu/">Department of
Economics</a>, and the <a href="https://dafre.rutgers.edu/">Department of
Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics</a>.
I manage the Libraries' collections, give instructional sessions, and
help researchers and students locate information in these disciplines. I am also the New Brunswick Libraries Point of Contact for Government Documents and Statistical Data Services.</p>
<p>Some occasional thoughts about data and other things are at my <a href="https://ryanwomack.com/blog">blog here</a>. I also maintain the Libraries research guide for
<a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/data">Data</a> and for <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/economics">Economics</a>.</p>
<p>A current focus for me is the development of useful guides to data and statistical resources related to Mongolia and the countries of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan).
The <a href="https://camgdp.org">Central Asia and Mongolia Gender Data Portal (CAMGDP)</a> exemplifies this.</p>
